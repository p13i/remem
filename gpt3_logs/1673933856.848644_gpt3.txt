When it comes to clothing for Toronto, it is important to be prepared for all four seasons. In the summer months, light and breathable clothing is recommended, such as shorts, t-shirts, and light dresses. For the colder winter months, heavier clothing such as sweaters, coats, and boots are recommended. Layering is also a great way to stay warm in the winter months. Additionally, rain gear such as umbrellas and raincoats are recommended for the rainy summer months.
